				<h2>Pomodoro Technique 番茄鐘工作法</h2>
				<p>
					Pomodoro techinique, which is also known as tomato timer technique, is a well-known time managing method cited by Francesco Cirillo. <br/> 
					The core idea of Pomodoro techinique is to tear time into small pieces. The most common way is to divide usable time into 25-min unit, and people are more likely to focus on things on hands in this short period of time. <br/>

					However, the actual application of pomodoro techinique is not quite easy. There are some points that people should pay extreme attention to when trying pomodoro techinique. <br/>
					First, before dividing the time, the first step is to calculate today's usable hours. For example, even though I work 8 hours a day, there could be one hour of meeting and another hour of job-assigning, and not to mention that I sometimes spend a little time chatting with colleague. After deducting the taken time, there comes the real usable time. <br/>
					Second, instead of putting everything you have to do into the schedule, try to list things out and specify the deadlines. The next step is to estimate how many 25-min units you need to finish each tasks, and them arrange time into today's scedule with the consideration fo their emergency levels. <br/>
					Here we get the elementary pomodoro scedule. With this small-unit secdule, we can definitely work with higher productivity. I believe distrctions would be willing to wait for just a few minutes.
