			<h2>Autobiography</h2>
			I am <b>Syue, Wen Rou</b>. My English name is Natalie and most of my friends call me Nata for short. I’m a fourth-year student in <b>National Tsing Hua University</b>, majoring in <b>foreign language and literature</b>. I grew up in Koahsiung, the biggest city in Southern Taiwan. The weather in my hometown is always quite warm, and so are the people there. People in Koahsiung are always friendly and warmhearted. I will also describe myself as a warm and outgoing person. One of my interests is to interact and make friends with people from different groups and backgrounds. <br/>
			During my college life, I joined several clubs and took part in quite many activities. I was the vice president of the student association of our department, which taught me to deal with “official” relationship with other departments and school offices. I was also a member of Koahsiung Group Association, in which I met dozens of friends from various departments and shared our stories to broaden each other’s horizons. Besides, I attended Bee Partner Program held by the Office of Global Affairs. The program is set up to help Newbies, foreign students in NTHU, get familiar with new environment in a short time and ease cultural shock caused by cultural difference. With this program, I got to know friends all over the world and try to explore the world beyond my comfort zone. <br/>
			To summarize my college life, the most precious thing I have acquired in the past three years is countless good friends as well as the wonderful and valuable memories we create together. <br/>
