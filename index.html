			<h2>Autobiography</h2>
			I am <b>Syue, Wen Rou</b>. My English name is Natalie and most of my friends call me Nata for short. I’m a fourth-year student in <b>National Tsing Hua University</b>, majoring in <b>foreign language and literature</b>. I grew up in Koahsiung, the biggest city in Southern Taiwan. The weather in my hometown is always quite warm, and so are the people there. People in Koahsiung are always friendly and warmhearted. I will also describe myself as a warm and outgoing person. One of my interests is to interact and make friends with people from different groups and backgrounds. <br/>
			During my college life, I took part in several clubs and activities such as the student association of our department, Koahsiung Group Association and Bee Partner Program. The most precious thing I have acquired in the past three years is countless good friends.
